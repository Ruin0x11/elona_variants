      - name: Difficulty based on degree of progress
        desc: Changes the formulas for many game mechanics to be based on a degree of progress instead of the player's level.
        notes: This is quite a far-reaching change. In OpenNefia, all of these formulas would have to be modularized into separate functions, so they can be overridden using advice or similar.
