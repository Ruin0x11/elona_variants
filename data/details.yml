      - name: Tag Teams
        desc: Allows two allies to occupy the same tile. The first ally decides movement while the second acts independently. There are many subtle behaviors with this mechanic, such as AP gain being shared between both characters.
        notes: As with riding, this will need an engine feature allowing for more than one character to occupy a tile, and getting the "primary" character on a tile for the purposes of things like movement or attacking/defense. Also, this feature can be combined with riding, allowing up to 3 characters to occupy a single tile.
